# CEN3031 Project - Group 92
## UF Parking Map Plus
A project that aims to make a UF parking map which is understandable and easy to use in Golang and Typescript. For those unfamiliar with the current parking structure, it becomes inconvenient for them to find the next available parking spot. Few resources provide users with details on the parking situation and the places where they can park, thus making it more difficult for every driver trying to park on campus. To address this issue, the team plans to add filtering options to the map such as defining the type of permit the user has, the time of day when certain parking spots are available, road closures, etc. It is also essential to understand the usersâ€™ needs, so the team will achieve this by collecting data and using feedback from others to refine the program. This application will make finding parking at UF quicker and easier for students, faculty, staff, and visitors.
