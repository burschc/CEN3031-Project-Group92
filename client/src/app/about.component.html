    <p>Hello! We are a software engineering team working to help students, staff, 
        and visitors find their way around campus. For those unfamiliar with the 
        current parking structure, it becomes inconvenient for them to find the 
        next available parking spot. Few resources provide users with details on 
        the parking situation and the places where they can park, thus making it 
        more difficult for every driver trying to park on campus. To address this 
        issue, we have added filtering options to the map such as defining the 
        type of permit the user has, the time of day when certain parking spots are 
        available, road closures, etc. </p>
